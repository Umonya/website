Umonya holds weekend-long courses multiple times a year which cover basic programming concepts and aim to give students the\u00a0tools to pursue programming in their own time, outside of a conventional classroom environment.</span></p>\n<h2>Who do we teach?</h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-ZA\">Registration is open to any learner between the ages of 12 and 18, the only requirements are a bit of curiosity and the willingness to learn.</span></p>\n<h2>What do we teach?</h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-ZA\">Python! Basic programming topics are covered using the Python language. Python is simple, syntactically light, emphasises explicit over implicit usage (which is great when learning something for the first time). But most of all, it\u2019s fun!</span></p>\n<h2>Who teaches?</h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-ZA\">Umonya courses are run thanks to the support of a group of volunteers, ranging from students to seasoned IT professionals, all from within the Cape Town tech community. If you're interested in getting involved, send us an <a href=\"mailto:nina@umonya.com\">email</a>!</span></p>",
